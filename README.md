Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I used the Love2d Game tutorial to create an updated version of the snake game and made some changes to it. I also started on the second game which is Tic Tac Toe. I am thinking of using my Pong lab as the third game for the third game because doing multiple games is harder than I thought.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
I haven't found a way to combine all the games into a single file so the user can select the game they want to play.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

For the Tic Tac Toe game I was able to draw the board fairly easily. I added images of X and O. I am able to move the picture but I haven't been able to find a way to stamp the in the cells that I want (just like "turtle.stamp" . I think I may have to use love.keypressed or love.mousepressed instead to put the X ans O in place.
